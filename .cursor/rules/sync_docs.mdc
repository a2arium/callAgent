# Documentation Synchronization Rule

When implementing new features or making changes to existing functionality, ensure that the corresponding documentation in the `docs` folder is updated to reflect these changes.

## Guidelines

1. For each new feature:
   - Add appropriate documentation in the relevant files in the `docs` folder
   - Include usage examples where applicable
   - Document any configuration options

2. For modifications to existing features:
   - Update the relevant documentation to reflect the changes
   - Ensure examples are still valid
   - Note any breaking changes prominently

3. For deprecations or removals:
   - Mark deprecated features clearly in the documentation
   - Provide migration paths where possible
   - Update or remove examples that reference removed functionality

## Location

Documentation should be maintained in the `docs` folder, with a structure that mirrors the codebase organization where appropriate.

## Review Process

Code reviews should include verification that documentation has been updated alongside code changes.
